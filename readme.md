#Simple File Upload 
#### For content editors who don't care where their files go, and developers who do
A Template Resource Input Filter for MODx Revolution 2.2+

------------------------------------

The Simple File Upload TV input provides the simplest possible file upload experience for the end user, 
offering single-button file selection & uploading without the use of the MODx file manager. File save paths are 
set on the TV itself, so the content-editor doesn't have to worry about where to save to.

### Installation Instructions
Install this package through the Package Manager or download from the [MODx Extras Repository](link to come).
Once installed, 'Simple File Upload' will become an option in the TV Input Type selection list.


### Input Configuration Options
While hiding many of these features from the Resource editor, Simple File Upload TVs are very customisable! They 
work with any stream-based (filesystem) mediasource, can be saved to a custom path within the source, and optionally 
prefix a string to the filename in order to make maintainance and curation of uploaded files easier over time. 
You can even restrict file upload types by specifying required MIME types!

#### Placeholders
Both the file `Save Path` and `File Prefix` fields can be customised by editing the corresponding fields in 
the TV Input Options tab. Both options can be customized dynamically with several placeholders:

* `{r}` - Resource ID
* `{t}` - TemplateVar ID
* `{u}` - User ID
* `{d}` - Day of month
* `{m}` - Month
* `{y}` - Year
      
#### Advanced Save Path routing using Snippets
You can also specify a snippet that returns a path string for advanced routing by using the @SNIPPET prefix
e.g. `@SNIPPET myPathingSnippet`


#### Restricting file types using MIME
MIME types describe the type of file to be uploaded and relate to the file extension.
Multiple upload types can be specified using a comma-separated list.

e.g. `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `application/pdf`
